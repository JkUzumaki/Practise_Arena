Assign const int to a non const int ptr will generate error.
	Because, 
	const variable cannot be changed.
	non const pointer value can be changed by dereferencing the value.
	Since it violates the intention of using const

When the pointer is a const and the value is not const, still the statement is valid
Here the value can be modified but the content cannot be modified through the pointer
But the variable the const pointer point to can be changed.

const pointer
	To make a pointer constant (whose value cannot be changed after initialization)
	Here the pointer can point to only one location and cannot be modified.
	Here the value the pointer pointing to can be modified provided value is not a const.
	
	Its also possible to point the pointer to a const location along with value not be modified through pointer.
	But still the value can be modified through the value variable.
