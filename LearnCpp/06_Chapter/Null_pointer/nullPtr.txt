When a pointer is not initialized during their instantiation, they will point to some garbage address by default.
A pointer can also hold null value instead of address. A null value is a special value that means the pointer is not pointing to anything.
A pointer holding a null value is called NULL POINTER.

Note:
	Deferencing a pointer holding garbage address lead to undefined behaviour and the same applies to null pointer as its not holding.
	Deferencing means "going to the address the pointer contains and accessing the value in it".

But the NULL is a integer, using of integer for pointer is not a good one. Hence in C++11 nullptr was introduced.

nullptr is a keyword and rvalue constant.
C++ will convert nullptr to any pointer type.
