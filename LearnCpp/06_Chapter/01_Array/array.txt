Initializing the array:
        1. Array can be initialized based on the position (via index).
        2. Array can be initialized based on the initializer list.

        uninitialized data are assigned with zero vale, which is referred to as zero initialization.

	we can define a array without giving the size during the initialization, but the drawback of that is method updation of that array is not possible
