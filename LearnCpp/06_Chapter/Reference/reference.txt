A reference is a type of C++ variable that acts as an alias to another object or value.
C++ support three kinds of references:
	1. Reference to non const
	2. Reference to const
	3. R value reference

Note:
	Reference must be initialiazed when created.
	A const value needs a const reference
	Reference cannot be reassigned.
	Reference are much safer than pointers.
	
using reference to pass array to a function
	Here the decaying(where pointer to value) does not happen, because of which size cannot be caluclated in pointer but 
	with reference we can pass the reference and size can be calculated.
